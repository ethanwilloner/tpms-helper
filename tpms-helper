# TPMS Helper v1
# Bash shell script to guide testing of Toyota PMV-107J TPMS sensors using rtl_433
# Requires bash >4.0, rtl_433, jq
# for more information, see README.md

# Minimum signal strength level for detection.
# Decrease if no sensor is detected
# Increase if multiple sensors are detected
readonly MINLEVEL="-0.5"
# Sensor type, default is 110 for Toyota's PMJ-107V. See rtl_433 docs for more options
readonly SENSOR_TYPE="110"
# Receive frequency to listen for signals, in Hz. Default is 315 MHz for Toyota sensors
readonly RX_FREQ="315000000" 
# Time in seconds to listen for signals.
# Default is 60, as Toyota sensors xmit every 60s. Other sensors may need more
readonly DURATION="60"

# define command to run rtl_433
readonly RUNSDR="rtl_433 -M level -f ${RX_FREQ} -F json -T ${DURATION} -R ${SENSOR_TYPE} -Y minlevel=${MINLEVEL}"
